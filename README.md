# UDP-playback
User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a Transport Layer protocol. UDP is a part of the Internet Protocol suite, referred to as UDP/IP suite. Unlike TCP, it is an unreliable and connectionless protocol. So, there is no need to establish a connection prior to data transfer. 
The User Datagram Protocol, or UDP, is a communication protocol used across the Internet for especially time-sensitive transmissions such as video playback or DNS lookups. It speeds up communications by not formally establishing a connection before data is transferred.
This c++ code implements the UDP message transfer functionality at the transport layer.
First run the UDPserver.cpp and then UDPclient.cpp, after compiling with g++.
